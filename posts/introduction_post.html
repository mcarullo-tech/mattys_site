        <h2>My First Post</h2>

        <p>This is my first motherfucking blog post! To be honest, this is kind of fun. Maybe I'll try to take this more seriously.
        It's kind of a cool idea to have a corner of the internet all to yourself: whatever you wanna make, whatever you wanna write,
        you can do it! You can't act that way when you're working at a company, because your work is representative of them, not you.
        But as an individual, you can do or act as you please. I don't mean like, "Oh finally I can say all the degenerate shit 
        I wanna say without getting in trouble!" The rules of common decency still apply. I just mean, moreso like you can represent
        yourself more in the way that YOU see yourself, instead of the way you THINK you need to represent yourself to gain headway 
        in career or whatever.</p>

        <p>Also, its different from regular social media because, as far as I'm concerned, nobody's gonna see this shit. With Instagram,
        or fucking Tiktok or whatever people use, theres always the lingering thought of how many followers you have, how many
        likes your posts get, etc. Also, lets say you wanna log onto Instagram to post a picture. Next thing you know you're looking
        at AI slop or some softcore shit... these are literally billion dollar corporations that have perfected the art of harvesting
        our attention for advertiser profit. So a blog kind of helps me get the creative side without the other nonsense of
        traditional social media.</p>

        <p>So anyways, let's consider this to be an introdctory post to test the waters. I mainly want to work on making the website
        somewhat presentable, as it could be a portfolio project of sorts. But if I start to have too much fun, I'll just keep
        it for myself. Anyways, I think I'll put a cute picture of Gingy at the end of this to keep things light.</p>

        <p>See you on the flipside!</p>
