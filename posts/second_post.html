        <h2>Thinking Out Loud</h2>

        <p>You would think it would be really easy to write something out. It's the same as talking, or thinking, which we do all the time. If anything it's easier
          than talking since you have more time to think about what you wanna say. But this actually renders it more difficult. When you stop to think about what you
          wanna say, you might just realize that you have nothing worth saying. In a conversation it's different, since there is the pressure to respond to someone's
          question, or simply to avoid the uncomfortable feeling which silence tends to draw in social settings</p>

        <p>It can be incredibly difficult to sit with your thoughts. There exists such easy access to stimulation and cheap forms of entertainment that there's really
          no need to. If I am waiting in reception for a doctor's appointment, why the fuck am I gonna just sit there and stare at the wall when I can watch an AI
          video of Trump and Putin dancing to ABBA? Either way its dead time, so why does it matter how we use it?</p>

        <p>I don't know man, I don't wanna be this pretentious asshole acting like I am better than everyone else since I don't use social media. Lord knows I waste enough
          fucking time on Reddit and Youtube to make up for my lack of useage of Instagram and Tiktok. The worst are those assholes who are like "Oh you use Tiktok??"
          All judgemental, meanwhile they got fuckin 6 hours a day of screentime of Instagram Reels... Bro its the same shit!! People just wanna feel superior
          and will do so via whatever means they can.</p>
        
        <p>Anyways, if I'm gonna continue this blog I should probably pick a theme instead of just writing nonsense. Even if I don't share it with anyone, I still think
          it'd be nice to have it somewhat presentable, or to make it something that I myself might enjoy reading. I have some ideas (sort of) but I'm not sure. I don't wanna
          do anything crazy, I'm moreso interested in creative writing and just doing nonsense. But <i>structured</i> nonsense. Maybe it could be sort of a comedy blog?
          I don't know man. Even the layout is still super basic. It's not that different from what AI generated, although I did kinda put my own spin on some elements.
          It's mostly been a fun way for me to learn HTML and CSS, but theres obviously a lot more for me to do.</p>

        <p>Finally, I don't know if I wanna make this public or not. Like realistically, who the fuck is gonna find this. And furthermore, who the fuck is gonna <i>read</i>
        this? Like who the fuck reads blogs? Hell, <i>I don't even read blogs!!</i> The idea of sharing stuff I created online is definitely something I'd like to do
        in the near future, but maybe not with this blog. This can be sort of practise.</p>

        <p>Anyways, here a fucking picture of Shiva. See you on the flipside!</p>
