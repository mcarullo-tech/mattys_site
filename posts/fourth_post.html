        <h2>A Case for Death</h2>

        <p>Why even waste time being alive? If you think about it, being alive is really a waste of time. If your goal was to move out,
          would you start building a house brick by brick, or go out and buy a fucking house.=? Obviously you would do the latter,
          why would anyone wanna take the longer and more difficult route? In either case, the outcome is the same, so why not choose
          the more direct route?</p>

          <p> The same could be said about life. Why waste time trying to figure things out, going out into the world and getting hurt,
            when you could get it all over with and just fucking kill yourself. In either case, the outcome is the same, so why not
            choose the more direct route? I thought we were all supposed to jizz ourselves over efficiency. SO, why not take the most
            efficient route? WHy the fuck do we waste energy getting up every morning, eating, shitting and pissing, when the end
            result is the same????? 
          </p>

          <p>ANyone who claims to care about "productivity" and "efficiency" who isnt actively planning their own suicide is a fucking
            poser. Sorry, but its true.
