        <h2>Life and Death in Varanasi</h2>

          <p>"How do people feel when they come to die here? Wouldn't their families be happy knowing they'll achieve Moksha?"</p>

          <p>The old man paused, his head tilting slightly as if he were listening to something far away. His eyes were clouded 
          with milky cataracts, but somehow he still managed to look straight through me.</p>

          <p>"When somebody dies," he said, smiling gently, "everyone is sad."</p>

          <p>Varanasi is the holiest city in Hinduism, a place where the boundary between life and death feels thin enough to touch.
          Pilgrims come here to die in hopes of achieving Moksha — release from the endless cycle of reincarnation and suffering. At 
          least, that’s the version you hear as an outsider. Ask three people in Varanasi how it works and you’ll get five answers. 
          One thing I learned quickly: nothing in this city is straightforward.</p>

          <p>After a week spent sweating through steel plants in Odisha, I decided to take a few days off and see Varanasi for myself.
          I arrived knowing very little, and somehow left knowing even less. On my first night, wandering through the maze of back 
          alleys with five shaky phrases of Hindi and an open mind, I felt invincible — right up until an old man sitting outside his 
          convenience store waved me over.</p>

          <p>He introduced himself as the head of an organization called “Burning &amp; Learning,” which, according to him, 
          taught Westerners about Hindu culture and also arranged cremations for students — for a generous fee. A priest later 
          told me that cremating foreigners at the Ganga was impossible. In Varanasi, truth is more of a suggestion than a fact.</p>

          <p>After explaining the mysteries of life, death, and everything in between, the old man invited me to watch a cremation. 
          I don’t usually treat death so casually, but the intoxication of being somewhere so ancient, so unapologetically alive, 
          pushed me to say yes.</p>

          <p>The pyre had only just been lit. Most of the body was still visible. I remember the foot most clearly — sticking out at 
          an odd angle, refusing to burn, as if the man were resisting his final transformation.</p>

          <p>A boy approached me, maybe twelve years old. “My brother,” he said, pointing to the pyre. I froze, suddenly aware of 
          how intrusive I must have seemed, but the family insisted I stay. The boy pulled out his phone and showed me a photo of his 
          brother. I expected a smiling portrait. Instead, it was a close-up of a man with his skull split open from a motorbike 
          accident. No helmet.</p>

          <p>As the flames grew, the boy pressed himself against my side and lifted his phone again.</p>

          <p>“Selfie, selfie!”</p>

          <p>He angled the camera so the two of us filled one side of the frame and the burning body filled the other. 
          The stubborn foot still jutted out, glowing red in the firelight.</p>

          <p>What was I supposed to do? Refuse? Lecture him on grief? Explain cultural boundaries that didn’t exist here?</p>

          <p>So I smiled. He smiled. The pyre roared behind us.</p>

          <p>And in that moment — absurd, intimate, unsettling — I realized the old man had been right. When somebody dies, 
          everyone is sad. But sadness looks different everywhere.</p>
