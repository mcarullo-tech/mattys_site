        <h2>Feeling Hopeless</h2>

        <p>Man its so fucking weird how one second, I will get this surge of energy, this feeling of hope, the notion that
          I have domain over my life. My vision of the future is clear: I want to explore the world, develop awesome skills
          like programming and robotics, and live this fulfilling life.</p>

        <p>I dont know what the fuck happens, but the next minute I am completely devoid of life and energy. I have no clear
          idea of what I want to do in the future and, totally engulfed with indecisiveness and hopelessness, I contend myself
          by slipping into old habits and doing nothing at all. Maybe if I pinpoint what it is thats shifts my energy in this way,
          I could figure out a way to avoid it.</p>

        <p>I think the reason I am feeling hopeless now is because this week has kinda gona shitty. I was all gung-ho about
          talking to Shinny to ask for some time off, and he did seem responsive about it, like I <i>could technically do it</i>,
          but the conversation did not really progress further than that. I mean, I guess I should start with just a month off,
          as that's all my vacation time (and then some), then take it from there.</p>

        <p>It just sucks because I know this life is not aligned with what I want, but I am having so much difficulty changing it.
          Like, I have some <i>ideas</i> of things I'd like to do, but its so fucking hard to put them into action. Like, for example,
          on the path of engineering, I think I'd like to work on designing robots. But despite my mechanical design experience
          at Tesla, I keep getting rejected from every job I apply to. Actually, I usually receive no response at all. I keep on
          applying and applying, but I feel like its going nowhere. For gods sake, I've been doing the same shit since fucking 2019
          first year in university already applying to co-ops like 2 weeks into the fucking semester.</p>

        <p>I actually came across some of my early resumes and its hilarious how shit they are. Looking back I can't believe
          I was ever hired anywhere. But fuck man, it feels like nothing has changed. Its still just as difficult to get callbacks.
          And even more demoralizing when I get a callback, get all invested, I fucking read up on the company, study my engineering
          fundamentals, rehearse my fucking answers, do a good job, then STILL dont get a callback!!!</p>

        <p>The truth is, Tesla put me in an awkward situation, where shitty companies dont wanna hire me since they think I am
          overqualified (spoiler alert: Im not) and good companies dont wanna hire me because theyre so competitive. Truth is,
          I never would have landed a Tesla internship based on my own merit. Actually, neither would have a lot of people.
          It was sort of weird seeing it on the inside. As a dumbass engineering student with no hope to ever accomplish anything of 
          merit in life, we look into FAANG as this magical realm of super elites, as if their engineers shit gold and their farts
          smell like fresh flowers. When in reality, they are just as stupid as the rest of us. Many of them got lucky with their
          resume submissions, many were referred by friends or family.</p>

          <img src="../images/cute_cow.jpg" alt="Cute Cow">

        <p>Probably <i>on average</i> a Tesla engineer is more intelligent than a Hatch engineer, but now by that much. Especially
        starting out. Like, I dont mean to say that everyone who works in Big Tech is stupid. Most of them are smart. Some 
        are geniuses. And just like in any other group of congregated humans, there are a lot of fucking idiots. The same can be
        said at Hatch. Lots of smart/average people, some really smart, and some really dumb.</p>

        <p>Perhaps I should have clung for dear life onto my opportunity to stay with Tesla. It would have "set me up for life",
          whatever that means. I could have had better opportunities than I do now, which is to say, I would have more than 0.
          The thing is, I really didnt enjoy working there. Like, some aspects were good, I liked being responsible for projects
          where I could have real impact, I liked working in a cool city surrounded by friends my age. I liked the close
          proximity to nature. But I didn't really enjoy a lot of the work, nor the prospect of working crazy hours, which I think
          scared me a lot more before because now I see that having nothing to do is equally shitty.</p>
        
        <p>But like, I feel like at the time I gave it my best shot, but I didnt push myself to the brink of destruction.
          Which saying it now sounds ridiculous, but if it would have helped me to avoid the garbage life I have now, perhaps it
          would have been worth it. IDK man, I got scared when people told me they were depressed moving to the Bay area working
          crazy hours, like they couldnt make friends because they were always at work, and everyone around them was doing the same.
          Like think about it, practically everyone in the Bay Area is a type A nutjob who is so career obsesses that they were
          ready to drop their friends and family at home to move to an oversized business park.</p>

        <p>But unfortunately my current life is just as shit, perhaps more. I hate my life, yet for some reason I am too afraid
          to change it. I cling to this shit job because it is all I have, but I dont even like it. FUCK man. This fucking sucks.</p>
