              <p><i>Ciao ragazzi!</i> My name's Matthew, welcome to my site! I'm sort of at a loss for how to describe myself...
              Normally, I would start this spiel with "I'm a mechanical engineer from the University of Waterloo..." but that doesn't
              really capture who I am. I guess I'm still sort of figuring that out.</p>

              <p>In the meantime, lets cover some basic information. I was born and raised in the suburbs just outside of Toronto,
              Canada; a place I've called home for most of my life. While I have strong family roots here, my heart belongs to the road:
              over the past couple years I've solo-travelled to Italy for a month, done short work trips to Colombia and India, and
              mountain biked in Iceland!</p>
              
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="about-text-full">
              <p>Another immutable truth about me is my love for the gym... This is perhaps the only facet of my life which has persisted
              since even before starting high school, and I am so glad it did. No matter how crappy any given day has been, I can always
              find solace in my dark and sweaty temple dedicated to the worship of iron.</p>

              <p>This website will largely be dedicated to exploring <i>creativity.</i> It has always bothered me that I've been so
              deeply entrenched in consumer culture without actually producing anything of my own. This website aims to change that.
              Part of it involves learning to code, a skill which I've flirted with in the past, but now aim to woo more convincingly.
              I'll also be exploring some creative writing and artwork.</p>

              <p>Thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoy my site.</p>
