        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Matthew and I am a fucking idiot from fucking nowhere. Man it feels so
            weird to introduce myself without the obligation to state my profession. I am so 
            used to giving my rehearsed speech of <i>"Hi, my name is Matthew and I'm a mechanical
            engineer from..."</i> It's weird that this has sort of become my identity when in reality
            I don't associate myself with it at all. In fact, I don't like it very much at all,
            yet is has become such a huge part of who I am. I guess that's something to think about. </p>

        <p>In the jovial spirit of identity crisis, I have created this site to help me pivot to
            another career which I have no interest in: <i>software development!</i> You know what they say,
            when one type of engineering isn't working out for you, the obvious path forward is to
            sink a bunch of time into another!</p>

        <p>But in all seriousness, I am hoping this can be a sort of creative outlet for me.
            I have been feeling the desire to create something, but it has been difficult to figure
            out what. I feel like a website/blog would be an interesting idea because it is a sort of
            intersection between what <i>I want to do (be creative)</i> and what I feel like <i>I should do 
            (Learn to code).</i></p>

        <p>In any case, hope you enjoy my site!</p>
